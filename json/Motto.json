{ title:”Motto”, text: “<p>The fundamental principle of a moral society:</p>
<p>The obliteration of any individual who has not willfully or forcibly endangered another, even if that individual is thought to be &#x201c;insignificant&#x201d;, is a much more important event than all the political, religious, and national events, and all the scientific, artistic, and technical progress of all countries and people taken together.</p>
<p>Whoever thinks this is an exaggeration should imagine that he himself or someone he loves is that obliterated individual and he will immediately understand this principle.</p>” }
